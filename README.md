# Katas

Repository used for storing different katas I've worked on. Includes multiple languages. Used to work across platform and to have easy access to refactoring solutions at a later time, since the first solution is often not the best.

## Future goals:

- Add section for creating fun katas in different languages, not just solving them.

- Complete and add katas in more languages
